# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was configuring the accelerometer to to my arduino uno allowing it to read the acceleration and tilt needed to make my car. After many tries I was able to read my XYZ values on the serial monitor for Arduino IDE. Using ADXL345 and installing its software I used a sensortest to test the values.
