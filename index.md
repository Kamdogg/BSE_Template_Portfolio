# Final Milestone
My final milestone is allowing the bluetooth to read gestures from the accelorometer and have the car be able to move foward and backwards. In order for my robot to work I got the accelormeter, which reads gestures, to connect to my blutooth and allow the arduino micro to read the code. This allowed the car to move based off the gestures of the accelerometer

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was configuring the accelerometer to to my arduino uno allowing it to read the acceleration and tilt needed to make my car. After many tries I was able to read my XYZ values on the serial monitor for Arduino IDE. Using ADXL345 and installing its software I used a sensortest to test the values.
